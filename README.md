* tf_cnn: Convolution Neural Network teseted on notMNIST dataset
* tf_sentiment_analyzer: Sentiment analysis using Convolution Neural Networks
* tf_deep_neural_network: Deep Neural Network tested on (Oh God! Not this dataset again) MNIST dataset
* tf_gan: Generative Adversaria Network to generate (wait for it) MNIST digits
* tf_recurrent_neural_network: Recurrent Neural Network to generate text
* theano_dnn: Deep Neural Network implementation in Theano
* theano_rnn: Vanilla Neural Network implementation in Theano
* theano_sparse_autoencoder: Sparse autoencoder implementation in Theano
* gists: Gists of video lectures/research papers
* notebooks: iPython notebooks for deep learning

PS: Most of the code in here were implemented quite sometime ago and have not been updated. Thus, a lot of backward compatability might be broken (especially with TensorFlow..)
